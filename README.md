This side project is to for me to practice with sql and see how much can be done with sql
Its been awesome programming this as I keep getting new ideas to expand on it so I think I'm gonna work on this for a while.
I wanted to practice with SQL my making an account management system to start but I also want to use what I've learned from 
statistics and implement statistical analysis (Regression and Time Series) to try make predictions about business' finance.

For now I have mostly built and am still working on the base account management whuch is still really fun as I kept coming accross
new things about SQL.
My plan is to link the accounts to bussiness' to creaate a bigger relation and then add functionality for business management
which will hopefully be able to make predictions for future year profits etc.
I want to push myself with this by mixing in what I've learnt from my Statistics courses into this program which will prove to be
complex.
